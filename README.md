# CloudWatch Logs + AWS Lambda Log Processor

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use AWS Lambda to process real-time logs from Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The Lambda function decodes, filters, and prints log data automatically. This simulates a basic serverless monitoring pipeline.

## Purpose & Motivation

I created this project to:
- Practice real-world AWS serverless architecture
- Understand how CloudWatch Logs can trigger Lambda
- Build DevOps/Cloud Engineering portfolio with event-driven solutions
